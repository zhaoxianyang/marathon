      When using local persistent volumes that pin tasks onto agents,
      these values define how Marathon handles terminal states of these tasks.

      relaunchEscalationTimeoutSeconds:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        minimum: 0
        default: 3600
        description: |
          When a task using persistent local volumes cannot be restarted on the
          agent it's been pinned to, Marathon will try to launch this task on
          another node after this timeout. Defaults to 3600 (one hour).",

  UpgradeStrategy:
    type: object
    description: |
      During an upgrade all instances of an application get replaced by a new
      version.
      The upgradeStrategy controls how Marathon stops old versions and
      launches new versions.
    properties:
      maximumOverCapacity:
        type: number
        format: double
        minimum: 0.0
        maximum: 1.0
        description: |
          A number between 0 and 1 which is multiplied with the instance count.
          This is the maximum number of additional instances launched at any
          point of time during the upgrade process.
      minimumHealthCapacity:

        description: |
          A number between 0 and 1 that is multiplied with the instance count.
          This is the minimum number of healthy nodes that do not sacrifice
          overall application purpose. Marathon will make sure, during the
          upgrade process, that at any point of time this number of healthy
          instances are up.

        description: |
          A list of resource roles.
          Marathon considers only resource offers with roles in this list for
          launching tasks of this app. If you do not specify this,
          Marathon considers all resource offers with roles that have been
          configured by the `--default_accepted_resource_roles` command line flag.
          If no `--default_accepted_resource_roles` was given on startup,
          Marathon considers all resource offers. To register Marathon for a role,
          you need to specify the `--mesos_role` command line flag on startup.
          If you want to assign all resources of a slave to a role,
          you can use the `--default_role` argument when starting up the slave.
          If you need a more fine-grained configuration, you can use the
          `--resources` argument to specify resource shares per role.

      args?:
        type: array
        items: string
        description: |
          An array of strings that represents an alternative mode of specifying the
          command to run. This was motivated by safe usage of containerizer features
          like a custom Docker ENTRYPOINT. This args field may be used in place of
          cmd even when using the default command executor.
          This change mirrors API and semantics changes in the Mesos CommandInfo
          protobuf message starting with version `0.20.0`.
          Either `cmd` or `args` must be supplied.
          It is invalid to supply both `cmd` and `args` in the same app.
      backoffFactor?:
        type: number

        default: 1.15
        description: |
          Configures exponential backoff behavior when launching potentially sick
          apps. This prevents sandboxes associated with consecutively failing tasks
          from filling up the hard disk on Mesos slaves.
          The backoff period is multiplied by the factor for each consecutive
          failure until it reaches maxLaunchDelaySeconds.
          This applies also to tasks that are killed due to failing too
          many health checks.
      backoffSeconds?:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        minimum: 0

          A list of services upon which this application depends
          An order is derived from the dependencies for performing start/stop and
          upgrade of the application. For example, an application /a relies on the
          services /b which itself relies on /c. To start all 3 applications, first
          /c is started than /b than /a.

          Different executors are available.

          For every port that is zero, a globally unique (cluster-wide) port is

        description: |
          Normally, the host ports of your tasks are automatically assigned.
          This corresponds to the requirePorts value false which is the default.
          If you need more control and want to specify your host ports in advance,
          you can set requirePorts to true. This way the ports you have specified
          are used as host ports. That also means that Marathon can schedule the
          associated tasks only on hosts that have the specified ports available.
