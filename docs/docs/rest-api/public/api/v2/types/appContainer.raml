  ContainerPortMapping:
    type: object
    properties:
      containerPort:
        type: numbers.EphemeralPort
        description: |
          Refers to the port the application listens to inside of the
          container.
          It is optional and defaults to 0.
          For each containerPort with a value of 0 Marathon assigns the
          containerPort the same value as the assigned hostPort.
          This is especially useful for apps that advertise the port they
          are listening on to the outside world for P2P communication.
          Without containerPort: 0 they would erroneously advertise their
          private container port which is usually not the same as the
          externally visible host port.
      hostPort?:
        type: numbers.EphemeralPort
        description: |
          Retains the traditional meaning in Marathon, which is a random
          port from the range included in the Mesos resource offer.
          The resulting host ports for each task are exposed via the task
          details in the REST API and the Marathon web UI.
          hostPort is optional.
          In BRIDGE mode it defaults to 0 if left unspecified.
          In USER mode an unspecified hostPort does not allocate a port
          from a Mesos offer.
      labels?:
        type: label.KVLabels
        description:
          This can be used to add metadata to be interpreted by external
          applications such as firewalls.
      name?:
        type: strings.Name
        description:
          Name of the service hosted on this port.
          If provided, it must be unique over all port mappings.
      protocol?:
        type: strings.NetworkProtocol
        default: tcp
      servicePort?:
        type: numbers.EphemeralPort
        default: 0
        description: |
          Is a helper port intended for doing service discovery using a
          well-known port per service.
          The assigned servicePort value is not used/interpreted by
          Marathon itself but supposed to used by load balancer
          infrastructure.
          See Service Discovery Load Balancing doc page.
          The servicePort parameter is optional and defaults to 0.
          Like hostPort, If the value is 0, a random port will be assigned.
          If a servicePort value is assigned by Marathon then Marathon
          guarantees that its value is unique across the cluster.
          The values for random service ports are in the range
          [local_port_min, local_port_max] where local_port_min and
          local_port_max are command line options with default values of
          10000 and 20000, respectively.
